# Authsite Front-End

[Authsite](https://authsite.herokuapp.com/) is a simple authentication webapp built with the MERN Stack.

* Here, you can login locally, with email and password, or through external authentication services, GitHub in this case.

* The back-end is a REST API that uses Express.js, Passport.js and MongoDB to authenticate and store users.

* The front-end is a React App that uses Redux to persist the user information, and Chakra as the UI Framework which provides a modern look and a bult-in dark mode.
